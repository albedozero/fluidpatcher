# legacy SquishBox/FluidPatcher


This is a legacy repository for the SquishBox/FluidPatcher software used in the [SquishBox](https://www.tindie.com/products/albedozero/squishbox). The installer command `curl -L git.io/squishbox | bash` points here. The newer paradigm for this software separates [fluidpatcher](https://github.com/GeekFunkLabs/fluidpatcher) and [squishbox](https://github.com/GeekFunkLabs/squishbox) into separate repositories, so the SquishBox can continue to be developed as a general platform for a range of audio applications. This version of the software is being kept here as a signpost for users that find their way here via outdated links, etc - or those that prefer this older version of the code. Feel free to post questions/problems about this version in [Discussion](https://github.com/albedozero/fluidpatcher/issues) and [Issues](https://github.com/albedozero/fluidpatcher/discussions) - help will be provided as needed.
